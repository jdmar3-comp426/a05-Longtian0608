            <p>
                Pangu (盤古), who appeared in literature no earlier than about 200 C.E., was the first
                sentient being and creator. In the beginning there was nothing but a formless chaos.
                Out of this chaos there was born an egg, which remained for 18,000 years. When the forces
                of Yin and Yang balanced, Pangu emerged from the egg, and set about the task of creating the
                world. With a swing of his great axe, he separated Yin and Yang. The heavy Yin sank to become the Earth,
                while the light Yang rose to become the Heavens. Pangu stood between them, and pushed up the sky.

            <p>
                At the end of eighteen thousand years, Pangu laid to rest. His breath became the wind; his voice the thunder; left eye
                the sun and right eye the moon; his body became the mountains and extremes of the world; his blood formed rivers; his
                muscles the fertile lands; his facial hair the stars and milky way; his fur the bushes and forests; his bones the valuable
                minerals; his bone marrows sacred diamonds; his sweat fell as rain; and the little creatures on his body (in some versions,
                the fleas), carried by the wind, became human beings all over the world.
