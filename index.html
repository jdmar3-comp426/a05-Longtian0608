            <h1>Myths and Legends</h1>
            <p>
               Chinese mythology is a collection of cultural history, folktales and religious tradition
               that has been passed down for centuries in oral or written form. There are several aspects
               to Chinese mythology, including creation myths and legends, and myths concerning the founding
               of Chinese culture and the Chinese state. Chinese mythology generally
               concerns moral issues and informs people about their culture and values.

            <p>
                A unique characteristic of Chinese culture is the relatively late appearance in Chinese literature
                of creation myths. Those that do exist appear well after the foundation of Confucianism, Taoism, and
                folk religions. The stories exist in several, often conflicting, versions, with the creation of the
                first humans variously ascribed to Shangdi, Heaven, Nuwa, Pangu, and Yu Huang.
