            <p>
                One of the most important and popular figures in Chinese mythology, the Jade Emperor (玉皇) is the supreme ruler of Heaven
                and the first emperor of China. He is also considered to be an especially important Taoist deity. With all of its specialized
                roles and social hierarchies, the Jade Emperor’s court parallels the structure of ancient Chinese monarchies. The emperor’s
                fairness, benevolence, and mercy were traits that real Chinese emperors sought to emulate.

                Yu Huang (玉皇, or Jade Emperor), including representations of him such as
                Yuanshi Tianzun (元始天尊), Huangtian Shangdi (皇天上帝), appear in literature
                well after the establishment of Taoism in China.
