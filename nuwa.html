            <p>
                Appeared in literature no earlier than about 350 B.C.E.
                Said to have recreated, or created the human race.
                Her companion was Fuxi (伏羲), the brother and husband of Nuwa.
                These two beings are sometimes worshipped as the ultimate ancestor
                of all humankind. They are often represented as half-snake, half-human
                creatures. Nüwa was also responsible for repairing the sky after
                Gong Gong damaged the pillar supporting the heavens.
